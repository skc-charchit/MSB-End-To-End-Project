## Mortgage Backed Securities(MBS) End To End Machine Learning Project

## Prepayment-Mortgage-Trading-Analysis-and-Prediction

Welcome to the Mortgage Trading Analysis and Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive case study on mortgage trading, designed to help you understand the financial system, sharpen your data modeling, DAX, and financial analysis skills, and experience the dynamic environment of a mortgage trading desk.

## Project Overview

As a newly hired junior trader on a trading desk for a mortgage originator, you will:

Identify a population of mortgages to trade.
Evaluate each mortgage and each bid received from prospective buyers.
Execute trades based on your analysis.
This project aims to provide a unique perspective on the banking industry and improve your technical skills in data modeling, DAX, and financial analysis.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for analysis and prediction.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis, data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
reports/: Generated reports and visualizations.
README.md: This readme file.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic mortgage dataset. It includes information on mortgage loans and their performance, such as loan amounts, interest rates, borrower credit scores, loan-to-value ratios, remaining terms, and whether the loan has defaulted.

# Dataset Information:

loan_id: Unique identifier for each loan
origination_date: Date when the loan was originated
loan_amount: Amount of the loan
interest_rate: Interest rate of the loan
credit_score: Borrower's credit score at the time of origination
loan_to_value: Loan-to-value ratio at the time of origination
remaining_term: Remaining term of the loan in months
monthly_payment: Monthly payment amount
default: Indicator of whether the loan has defaulted (binary: 0 for no default, 1 for default)
bid_price: Price bid by prospective buyers (for simulation purposes)

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

# 1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/skc-charchit/MSB-End-To-End-Project.git
cd Mortgage-Backed-Securities(MBS)

# 2.Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv

# 3.Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
# Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:

python scripts/preprocess_data.py
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform exploratory data analysis:

jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
# Modeling and Evaluation
Run the modeling script to train and evaluate the machine learning models:

python scripts/train_model.py
# Interactive Dashboard
To explore the interactive dashboard, use a BI tool like Power BI or Tableau and connect it to the processed data. The dashboard will help you visualize the mortgage portfolio, bids, and analysis results.

# Reporting
Generate reports and visualizations using the notebooks and scripts provided. The reports will summarize the trading activity, including the mortgages traded, bids received, and financial outcomes.
